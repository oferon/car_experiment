        <p> <b> This simulation game is NOT compatible with Microsoft Internet Explorer and with iPad. </b></P>
        <p> <b> Please use Chrome or Safari web browsers with a PC or a Mac (but not iPad). </b></P>

        <p> The simulation includes ten short driving sessions and brief surveys between sessions. 
        In each session you will drive and collect coins by tapping repeatedly on the computer mouse pad as shown below:

      <p> <b> YOU MUST COLLECT AT LEAST 5 COINS IN EACH AREA. </b> Between areas you will need to cross lakes. You can either take a detour around the lake (do it yourself)
      or use a free shuttle service. To make a choice click on the buttons as shown below: </p>

      <p> <b> Important: </b> You are one of several people who are playing this simulation now. Scoring your experience with the the shuttle performance
      is likely to improve those services, but only if other participantes are also engaged in sending feedback. It is entirely up to you 
      to determine if it worth investing time in scoring shuttle services or not. Note that you will always be able to take the detour instead: </p>
