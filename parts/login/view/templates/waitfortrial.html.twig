        <p>  
        The simulation includes ten short driving sessions and brief surveys between sessions. 
        In each session you will drive and collect coins by tapping repeatedly on the computer mouse pad as shown below:    </p>
        Between areas you will need to cross lakes. You can either take a detour around the lake (do it yourself)
        or use a shuttle service. <b> EACH SHUTTLE RIDE COST 4 COINS. YOU CAN COLLECT COINS IN EACH AREA. </b> 
        To make a choice click on the buttons as shown below. </p>
        
      <p> <b> Important: </b> You are one of several people who are playing this simulation now. Scoring your experience with the the shuttle performance
      and providing accurate feedback (not compliments) is likely to improve services, but only if other participantes are also engaged in sending feedback. 
      It is entirely up to you to determine if it worth investing your time collecting coins and scoring shuttle services or not. 
      Note that you will always be able to take the detour instead: </p>
