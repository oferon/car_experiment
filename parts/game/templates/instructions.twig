        <p> <b> This simulation game is NOT compatible with Microsoft Internet Explorer and with iPad. </b></P>
        <p> <b> Please use Chrome or Safari web browsers with a PC or a Mac (but not iPad). </b></P>
        <p> <b> Reading the instructions below will take you 2 minutes, but it will help you play better and faster.  </b></P>

        <p> The simulation includes ten short driving sessions and brief surveys between sessions. 
        In each session you will drive and collect coins by tapping repeatedly on the computer mouse pad as shown below:

      <p> <b> YOU MUST COLLECT AT LEAST 5 COINS IN EACH AREA. </b> Between areas you will need to cross lakes. You can either take a detour around the lake (do it yourself)
      or use a free shuttle service. To make a choice click on the buttons as shown below: </p>

      <p> <b> Important: </b> You are one of several people who are playing this simulation now. Scoring your experience with the the shuttle performance
      is likely to improve those services, but only if other participantes are also engaged in sending feedback. It is entirely up to you 
      to determine if it worth investing time in scoring shuttle services or not. Note that you will always be able to take the detour instead: </p>

        <p> You are being asked to participate in this research study because you are interested in participating in a 
behavioral study. The purpose of this research study is to to promote our scientific knowledge, and the understanding of 
human social behavior. If you agree to participate, we will ask you to to play a driving simulation game. The duration of 
the simulation is about 20 minutes total. We request that you play it in a relaxed (preferably home) environment.  The 
simulation game includes four driving sessions of about ten minutes each, brief surveys between session, and a brief 
final survey. We will pay you $4 for completing this simulation. The simulation game will only collect statistical data. 
        No identifiable information will be collected. All statistical data obtained through this simulation game and 
surveys will be stored on secure servers at Hunter College. Your participation in this research is voluntary. If you 
have any questions, you can contact Ofer Tchernichovski [otcherni@hunter.cuny.edu]. If you have any questions about your
rights as a research participant or if you would like to talk to someone other than the researchers, you can contact 
CUNY Research Compliance Administrator at 646-664-8918.  </p>
